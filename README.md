# Manifest Tools for Talon

Provides scripts for generating a `manifest.json` and `_version.py` for your Talon package (folder) which includes Talon dependencies, contributions, versioning, and dependency checking.

Also includes a script for generating installation instructions.

## Installation

Clone this repository into your Talon user directory:

```sh
# mac and linux
cd ~/.talon/user

# windows
cd ~/AppData/Roaming/talon/user

git clone https://github.com/rokubop/talon-manifest-tools.git
```

## Scripts

### generate_manifest.py
Parses Python files using AST to detect Talon actions, settings, tags, lists, modes, scopes, and captures you contribute or depend on. Scans user directory to find all other packages with manifests to build an index of available packages. Maps your imported actions/settings to specific packages and their versions. Creates or updates `manifest.json` with all discovered information, preserving your manual edits to fields like name, description, etc.

```bash
python generate_manifest.py ../talon-package
```

### generate_version.py
Generates a `_version.py` file that exposes your `manifest.json` package version as a Talon action (e.g., `actions.user.my_package_version()`). Also includes automatic dependency validation on Talon startup, printing clear error messages if dependencies are missing or outdated with installation/update instructions for other packages that also have a `manifest.json` and `_version.py` generated by this tool.

```bash
python generate_version.py ../talon-package
```

### generate_install_block.py
Outputs formatted installation instructions for your package based on your `manifest.json`, including dependency information. Useful for quickly generating README installation sections.

```bash
python generate_install_block.py ../talon-package
```

## Example Manifest Output

```json
{
  "name": "talon-my-package",
  "title": "My Package",
  "description": "A brief description of what the package does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "namespace": "user.my_package",
  "github": "https://github.com/user/my-package",
  "preview": "",
  "status": "development",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "tags": ["productivity", "editing"],
  "dependencies": {
    "talon-ui-elements": {
      "version": "0.10.0",
      "namespace": "user.ui_elements",
      "github": "https://github.com/user/talon-ui-elements"
    }
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "contributes": {
    "actions": ["user.my_package_action"],
    "settings": ["user.my_package_setting"]
  },
  "depends": {
    "actions": ["user.ui_elements_show"]
  },
  "_generator": "talon-manifest-tools",
  "_generatorVersion": "2.0.0"
}
```

### Manifest Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| name | Package identifier (defaults to folder name, preserved on updates). Recommendation for folder & name: prefix with "talon-". |
| title | Human-readable package title. Recommendation: "Title Case" format |
| description | Brief description of package functionality |
| version | Semantic version number (Major.Minor.Patch) |
| namespace | Naming prefix for all talon actions in this package (e.g. `user.ui_elements` means all actions in this package are `user.ui_elements_*`). Best practice: all your actions should use the same namespace - you'll get warnings if they don't. |
| github | GitHub repository URL |
| preview | Preview image URL |
| author | Package author name |
| status | Recommended values: "development" (WIP - not ready for users), "experimental" (usable but expect minor bugs or breaking changes later), "stable" (production-ready), "inactive" (no longer maintained) |
| tags | Arbitrary category tags for the package |
| requiresTalonBeta | Auto-detected on first run (parrot/face/deck in .talon files, ctx.dynamic_list/ctx.selections in .py files). Once checked and set, the value is preserved on subsequent runs - manual changes are respected. |
| dependencies | Auto-generated. Required packages (other packages that also have `manifest.json` and `_version.py` generated by this tool) as dict mapping package name to object with `version` (minimum version required, e.g. "0.10.0" means 0.10.0 or higher), `namespace`, and `github` fields. Once set, versions are preserved - update manually if needed. |
| devDependencies | Dev-only dependencies (manually move items here from `dependencies` if only needed for testing/development) |
| validateDependencies | Whether to validate dependencies on Talon start (default: true if dependencies exist, omitted otherwise). Set to false to disable dependency validation. |
| contributes | Auto-generated. Actions/settings/tags/modes/etc. this package provides |
| depends | Auto-generated. Actions/settings/tags/modes/etc. this package uses |
| _generator | Tool that generated this manifest e.g. "talon-manifest-tools" |
| _generatorVersion | Version of the generator tool |
| _generatorRequireVersionAction | Whether the generator should require a version action (default: true if namespace exists). Set to false to disable version action requirement check |
| _generatorStrictNamespace | Whether the generator should validate namespace consistency (default: true). Set to false to allow multiple namespaces and skip validation warnings. Useful for collection packages like talon-community |

Most fields are preserved across regenerations, but `contributes`, `depends`, and `dependencies` are auto-generated each time.

## Troubleshooting

### Python Version Error

The script requires **Python 3.12 or higher**. If you get a version error, you can use Talon's bundled Python 3.13 instead:

**Windows:**
```bash
"C:\Program Files\Talon\python.exe" generate_manifest.py ../talon-package
```

**Mac:**
```bash
/Applications/Talon.app/Contents/Resources/python/bin/python3 generate_manifest.py ../talon-package
```

**Linux:**
```bash
~/.talon/bin/python3 generate_manifest.py ../talon-package
```
